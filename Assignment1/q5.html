        <u>The Night Circusis </u><i><b>.a captivating fantasy</b></i> novel set in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The story revolves around a <i><b>magical</b></i>competition between two <i><b>young</b>
        </i>illusionists, Celia and Marco, who have been bound by their mentors to a high-stakes duel. The circus, which serves as the venue for their rivalry, is no ordinary circus. Known as,<u>"Le Cirque des RÃªves" (The Circus of Dreams)</u>, it only operates at night and is filled with <i><b>fantastical, breathtaking</b></i>wonders that leave visitors entranced. As the competition intensifies, the stakes grow higher, and the characters' relationships deepen in unexpected and sometimes dangerous ways. With lush descriptions and intricate storytelling, Morgenstern weaves a tale of magic, love, and mystery that is as enchanting as the circus itself.</p>
