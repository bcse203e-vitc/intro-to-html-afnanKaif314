    <p>
        Daily exercise is essential for maintaining physical and mental health. It helps improve cardiovascular fitness, boosts energy levels, and strengthens muscles and bones. Regular physical activity also reduces stress, improves mood, and enhances sleep quality. Incorporating just 30 minutes of exercise into your daily routine can have long-term benefits for your overall well-being.
